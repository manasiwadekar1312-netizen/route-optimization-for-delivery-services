🚚 Last Mile Delivery Route Optimization (Advanced)

📌 Project Summary

The Last Mile Delivery Route Optimization project focuses on solving one of the most critical problems in logistics: delivering packages efficiently from a distribution point to multiple customer locations.

This project uses Python-based optimization and geospatial visualization to generate the shortest and most efficient delivery route. The final output is an interactive map displayed in a web browser, making results easy to understand for both technical and non-technical users.

⚙️ How the Project Works

1. Delivery locations are defined using latitude and longitude values


2. Distances between all locations are calculated using the Haversine formula


3. An optimization algorithm determines the best route order


4. The optimized route is plotted on an interactive map


5. Traffic levels are visually represented using different route colors
